## 1.4 Mainboard Swapping

In the following sequence, I will go through all the first steps I went through while building my node.

> Before you start building, ground yourself. Grounding can be done, for example, by reaching for the heater.

I've split the process into multiple sections to simplify the navigation of pictures. As the first step, we have to disassemble the motherboard and mount it into the new housing, acting as a cooler.

### 1.4.1 Disassembling the Motherboard

Remove the screws from the bottom of the NUC and open the case.

Unscrew the motherboard from the case.

Remove the cables from the motherboard, which is responsible for grounding and optional antennas. Use a narrow wrench for a better lever effect.

Be careful with moving the motherboard out of the case. You don't want to destroy tiny cables or bend data slots.

Now that you have removed the motherboard, securely put the old housing to the side.

Turn the motherboard to access the fan and its frame.

Remove the screws holding the fan in place to cool the processor.

Carefully unplug the thin 4-pin fan cables.

The screws used for the fan also held the old cooler in place.

Remove the processor cooler by gently pulling it upwards and placing it upside down on the table so you don't smear the heat-conductive paste.

Wipe off the heat conductive paste.

### 1.4.2 Swapping the Enclosure

Grab the new fanless housing, which also acts as a cooling block.

Unscrew the back panel for the motherboard connection possibilities.

![Swapping the Enclosure 2](/img/build_14.png)

Put the parts aside and turn the case around.

![Swapping the Enclosure 3](/img/build_15.png)

Remove the screws holding the bottom panel in place.

Next, get back to the motherboard and clean it with an appropriate alcoholic cloth.

![Swapping the Enclosure 5](/img/build_17.png)

Apply fresh thermal paste again and spread it as well as possible. Use only a thin layer. Otherwise, it will be pressed out the sides and stain the motherboard when screwed down.

![Swapping the Enclosure 6](/img/build_18.png)

In the next step, the motherboard must be screwed into the housing. Clean the cooling counterpart to the processor.

![Swapping the Enclosure 7](/img/build_19.png)

Search for the appropriate screws and spacers.

![Swapping the Enclosure 8](/img/build_20.png)

Insert the motherboard slowly and accurately from above. No thermal paste should be smeared but placed precisely on the intended surface.

![Swapping the Enclosure 9](/img/build_21.png)

Screw in the motherboard. Always tighten the screws for the motherboard in opposite directions and small increments. The motherboard should be pressed down evenly from all sides.

## 1.4 Mainboard Swapping

In the next sequence, I will go through all the first steps I went through while building my own node.

> Before you start building, ground yourself. Grounding can be done, for example, by reaching for the heater.

I've split the process into multiple sections to make navigation all pictures easier. As the first step, we have to disassamble the Motherboard and mount it into the new cooler housing.

### 1.4.1 Disassembling the Motherboard

Remove the screws from the bottom of the NUC and open the case.

Unscrew the motherboard from the case.

Remove the cables from the motherboard, responsible for grounding and optional antennas. Use a narrow wrench for better lever effect.

Be careful with moving the motherboard out of the case. You dont want to destroy tiny cables or bend data slots.

Now that removed the motherboard securely, put the old housing to the side.

Turn the motherboard to access the fan and its frame.

Remove the screws that are holding the fan in place for cooling the processor.

![Disassembling the Motherboard 7](/img/build_08.png)

Carefully unplug the thin 4-pin fan cables.

The screws used for the fan also held the old cooler in place.

Remove the processor cooler by gently pulling it upwards and place it upside down on the table so that you don't smear the heat conductive paste.

Wipe off the heat conductive paste.

### 1.4.2 Swapping the Enclosure

Grab the new fanless housing, also acting as cooling block.

Unscrew the back panel for the motherboards connection possibilities.

![Swapping the Enclosure 2](/img/build_14.png)

Put the parts aside and turn the case around.

![Swapping the Enclosure 3](/img/build_15.png)

Remove the screws holding the bottom panel in place.

![Swapping the Enclosure 4](/img/build_16.png)

Get back to the motherboard and clean it with an appropriate alcoholic cloth.

![Swapping the Enclosure 5](/img/build_17.png)

Apply fresh thermal paste again and spread it as well as possible. Use only a very thin layer, otherwise it will be pressed out the sides and stain the motherboard when it is screwed down.

![Swapping the Enclosure 6](/img/build_18.png)

In the next step, the motherboard must be screwed into the housing. Clean the cooling counterpart to the processor.

![Swapping the Enclosure 7](/img/build_19.png)

Search for the appropriate screws and spacers.

![Swapping the Enclosure 8](/img/build_20.png)

Insert the motherboard slowly and accurately from above. No thermal paste should be smeared, but should be placed exactly on the intended surface.

![Swapping the Enclosure 9](/img/build_21.png)

Screw in the motherboard. Always tighten the screws for the motherboard in opposite directions and in small increments. the motherboard should be pressed down evenly from all sides.
